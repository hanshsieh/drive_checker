# Drive Checker

## Prepare Environment
You need to download and install JRE (or JDK).
Or, alternatively, you can prepare your own bundled JRE, put it in a directory "jre", and put the
"jre" folder under the same directory as the exe.

## TODO
- Allow auto generating random test file
- Refactoring
- Beautify UI
